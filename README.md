# Simple RAG With Guardrails

This is a feasibility study project which I built a simple RAG with guardrails, and aim to test whether not allowing 
the large language model to output unwanted content is possible by leveraging the [NemoGuardrails](https://github.com/NVIDIA/NeMo-Guardrails) package released
by Nvidia.
